# Abstract
This project explores the relationship between college majors and their salaries. The dataset contains 50 different majors and the salaries of each of them. There is a column that gives the starting median salary for each major. There is also a column that gives the mid-career median salary for each major. Then, percent change is calculated to see how much more money the majors make from the start of their careers to the mid-points. Lastly, there are percentiles for each major. The 10th percentile means there 90% of people make a better salary. 25th means 75% make more, 75th means 25% make more, and 90th means only 10% make more. The higher percentile you are in the more money you make because you are near the top of your field. 
# Conclusion
From the visualizations provided in this project, viewers can determine what the earning potential of the major they chose. If they are prospective college students, they could narrow done what field intrests them based on earning potential (if that matters to them). Employeers gain a perspective on what is a fair wage to pay their employees based on these visualizations.
